# Hollywood

** This is an experiment. Your probably should not use this, I may stop working on it, etc. **

Hollywood creates apps from plugins.

Here's the idea:

 1. Define your app's configuration.
 2. Add some plugins that use the configuration.

Examples of plugins:

 - Logger
 - Metrics
 - Configuration parser
 - Exception handling
 - Whatever

Don't use a singleton, use Hollywood!
